- how is real world computer use like streaming a movie or using excel captured by computing boolean functions? 
- boolean circuits vs TMs, universality, code-as-data and self-modifying programs 
- why a CPU captures this, core mapping between CPU and TM 
- CPU / electronic computer design choices (alternative ways to implement a TM, eng decisions)
